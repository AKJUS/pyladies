<p>
PyLadies is a group of women who use and love the Python programming language.
</p>
<p>
With 7 women leading and organizing events, and numerous others offering volunteer time and support, we're on track for increasing the percentage of females in the Python community to 50%.
</p>
<p>
Although we're largely LA-based, if you're from another city and need help starting a local PyLadies group or other flavor of local women's Python/other language community, contact us.  We can help you get the word out.
