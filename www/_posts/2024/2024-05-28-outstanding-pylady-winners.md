<TODO: photo of award winners at PyCon>

I am sure many of us know and have experienced ourselves: the PyLadies community is made up of many
remarkable members and volunteers that make significant contributions to bettering the Python
community.

To celebrate that, [Cheuk Ting Ho] proposed an idea to the PyLadies Global Council last year to 
recognize remarkable PyLadies. Cheuk saw many folks are doing amazing things for the community
and proposed the [Outstanding PyLady Award][blog announcement]. This new Outstanding PyLady Award
is meant to elevate diverse Pythonistas doing extraordinary community-elevating things, to highlight
their achievements, and to thank them for all the work they've contributed.

Each year, the PyLadies Global Council will be selecting a handful of folks from nominations from
the Python community at large (anyone in the Python community is encouraged to 
[nominate][nomination form]!). Award winners are recognized at PyCon US, and receive their choice of
either free registration & travel assistance to PyCon US, or a cash award of $1,000. Its intention
is to demonstrate that their service and contributions to the PyLadies community does lead to
recognition and reward. They also get a cute little pin to wear on their lanyards for all PyCons to
come, if they wish. <TODO: image of pin>

This is the first year of the Outstanding PyLady awards, and we got a whopping _**84 submissions**_ 
for nominations. Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to award all the nominations, although 
all of them are very clearly deserving. 

The PyLadies Global Council has selected 3 women to receive the inaugural award, and we are all so 
very excited to celebrate them. In alphabetical order by last name:

## Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe

TODO link to:

* twitter/mastodon/linked in
* PyLadiesCon talk
* DjangoCon US keynote
* Ghana chapter
* Mesrenyame & Friends organization

Abigail hails from the Ghana chapter of PyLadies, which she helped found in 2017. She and the Ghana 
chapter has in one way or another inspired at least 8 other chapters around the world to start up, 
including Liberia, Ethiopia, Zambia, Kenya, Finland, Cameroon, and _two_ in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo.

In her copious amounts of spare time, besides organizing PyLadies events, she co-organizes PyCon 
Africa, she spoke for the first PyLadies Conference that we had back in September of last year, 
she’s keynoted conferences like DjangoCon US, and has founded and is running an entire organization,
Mesrenyame & Friends, whose sole purpose is to inspire & support young girls in STEM. All in a day’s
work, right?


## Jessica Greene

TODO: link to:

* twitter/mastodon/linked in
* Python Pizza Hamburg
* D&I panel
* Berlin chapter
* CoC committee

Jessica Greene comes to us from Berlin, Germany - a PyLadies chapter that has some awesome stickers 
of their own. She has been the organizer for the Berlin Chapter for over 6 years. Her work has 
inspired other chapters to spin up, like Delhi, India. You might have caught her from this year's
PyCon US's Diversity & Inclusion panel talk - she's a part of the PSF’s Code of Conduct Committee, 
which is a lot of unnoticed and important work. It's been said that Jessica has a penchant for 
automating the administrative tasks for her and her chapter organizers. But naturally, who wouldn’t! 
And when she's not organizing PyLadies events, or participating in committees, or writing Python 
code, she helps put on the Python Pizza Hamburg, a micro conference that combines Python talks and 
eating pizza (sign me up!).

## Maaya Ishida

TODO: link to

* twitter/mastodon/linked in
* PyLadies Caravan
* Tokyo chapter
* PyLadiesCon talk
* PyCon Hong Kong keynote
* PyCon JP Association

Maaya Ishida joins us from our Tokyo PyLadies chapter, which she has been involved with for 
_**10 years**_. Of course, that is not all that she's done; no PyLadies organizer can sit still. 
Maaya organizes the PyLadies Caravan, which is a series of events over the last 5 years, with the 
purpose of connecting with other PyLadies around the entire country of Japan. And she, too, was 
one of the inaugural speakers of the first PyLadies Conference, and a keynoter at PyCon HongKong 
last year. Of course she can't get enough, because she also volunteers for the PyCon JP Association.
