Many remarkable members and volunteers make up the PyLadies community and make significant
contributions to bettering the Python community.

To celebrate that, [Cheuk Ting Ho] saw many folks doing amazing things for the community and 
proposed establishing the [Outstanding PyLady Award][blog announcement] to the PyLadies Global
Council. This new Outstanding PyLady Award recognizes diverse Pythonistas doing extraordinary 
community-elevating things, highlights their achievements, and thanks them for all the work 
they've contributed.

Moving forward, every year the PyLadies Global Council will be selecting a handful of folks from 
nominations from the Python community at large (anyone in the Python community is encouraged to 
[nominate][nomination form]!). Award winners are recognized at PyCon US, and receive their choice of
either free registration & travel assistance to PyCon US, or a cash award of $1,000. Its intention
is to demonstrate that their service and contributions to the PyLadies community does lead to
recognition and reward. They also get a cute little pin to wear on their lanyards for all PyCons to
come, if they wish.

This is the first year of the Outstanding PyLady awards, and we got a whopping _**84 submissions**_ 
for nominations. Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to award all nominees, although all of 
them clearly deserve it. 

The PyLadies Global Council has selected 3 women to receive the inaugural award, and we are all so 
very excited to celebrate them. In alphabetical order by last name:

## Abigail Mesrenyame Dogbe

Abigail ([X][abigail_x], [LinkedIn][abigail_li]) hails from the üá¨üá≠ Ghana üá¨üá≠ chapter of PyLadies 
([X][ghana_x], [Instagram][ghana_inst], [GitHub][ghana_gh]), which she helped found in 2017. She and
the Ghana chapter has in one way or another inspired at least 8 other chapters around the world to
start up, including Liberia, Ethiopia, Zambia, Kenya, Finland, Cameroon, and _two_ in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

In her copious amounts of spare time, besides organizing PyLadies events, she co-organizes [PyCon 
Africa][pycon_af], has [keynoted for the first PyLadies Conference][abigail_pylcon] and others like 
[DjangoCon US 2023][abigail_django], and has founded and is running an entire organization, 
[Mesrenyame & Friends][mes_friends], whose sole purpose is to inspire & support young girls in STEM.
All in a day's work, right? üë©üèø‚Äçüíª

## Jessica Greene

Jessica Greene ([X][jessica_x], [LinkedIn][jessica_li], [Mastodon][jessica_mast]) comes to us from 
üá©üá™ Berlin, Germany üá©üá™ - a PyLadies chapter ([X][berlin_x], [Instagram][berlin_inst], [Meetup][berlin_meetup]) 
that has some awesome stickers of their own. She has been the organizer for the [Berlin chapter][berlin_site]
for over 6 years. You might have caught her from this year's [PyCon US's Diversity & Inclusion panel talk][pycon_di_panel] - 
she's a part of the PSF's [Code of Conduct Committee][psf_coc], which is a lot of unnoticed and important 
work. It's been said that Jessica has a penchant for [automating the administrative tasks][berlin_gh]
for her and her chapter organizers. But naturally, who wouldn't! And when she's not organizing 
PyLadies events, or participating in committees, or writing Python code, she helps put on the 
[Python Pizza Hamburg][pizza_hamburg], a micro conference that combines Python talks and eating 
pizza (üçï sign me up! üçï).

Check out Jessica's [many insightful blog posts][jessica_blog]!

## Maaya Ishida

Maaya Ishida ([X][maaya_x], [LinkedIn][maaya_li], [Facebook][maaya_fb]) joins us from our üáØüáµ 
[Tokyo PyLadies chapter][tokyo_site] üáØüáµ ([connpass][tokyo_conn], [Facebook][tokyo_fb], [X][tokyo_x],
[GitHub][tokyo_gh]), which she has been involved with for _**10 years**_. Of course, that is not all
that she's done; no PyLadies organizer can sit still. Maaya organizes the [PyLadies Caravan]
[caravan] üöê, which is a series of events over the last 5 years, with the purpose of connecting with
other PyLadies around the entire country of Japan. And she, too, was one of the [inaugural speakers 
of the first PyLadies Conference][maaya_pylcon], and a keynoter at [PyCon HongKong last year]
[maaya_pychk]. Of course she can't get enough, because she also volunteers for the [PyCon JP 
Association][pycon_jp] ([english site][pycon_jp_eng]).
