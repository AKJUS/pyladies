The PyLadies community is made up of many remarkable members and volunteers that make significant 
contributions to bettering the Python community. The Outstanding PyLady award is meant to elevate 
diverse Pythonistas doing amazing things, highlighting their achievements, and thanking them for 
all the work they've contributed.

Nominations are accepted year-round, but December 31st is the cut-off date for recognition at 
PyCon US 2025. Recognition will take the form of an award certificate, plus **one** of the following:

* Free registration and travel assistance (_if needed_) to PyCon US 2025 <sup>1</sup>, or
* A cash award of $1000 USD <sup>2</sup>.

Self nominations and multiple nominations are accepted (_and encouraged!_), as are nominations
from outside the PyLadies community; just fill out [this form] per nominee. Winners will be
notified by the Global Council.

Let us know about all the wonderful work that's been done this year and get those nominations in!
