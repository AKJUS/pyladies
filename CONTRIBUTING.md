# PyLadies Blog Guest Post Guidelines

<p>We accept guest posts for the PyLadies blog. Here is a guest post that you should read as samples of what we're looking for:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.pyladies.com/blog/get-the-most-out-of-your-conference-going-experience/">Get the Most Out of Your Conference-Going Experience</a></li></ul>

## Topics

<p>We're looking for posts about Python and the ladies doing cool things with it. Our audience includes both experts and newer programmers. If you're writing a more expert level post, consider pointing newer programmers to resources to get started with.</p>

## Length

<p>Posts should be 500 words in length. If your post is much longer (thousands of words), consider whether it could be broken into two connected posts.</p>

## Images

If you wish to include images, they must be 500 pixels wide or less. You must own the images you're submitting, or they must be available under a Creative Commons license.

## Formatting

1. Write your guest post in Markdown (Suggestion: Mou.app for mac is created for Markdown - gives you a preview while you write) (Suggestion #2: http://dillinger.io/ is a web app that provides a live preview when you're writing in Markdown).

A cheatsheet for Markdown commands is at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</a>.

2. The very top of the blog post needs the following (including the three dashes before and after the layout/title/tags):

```
---
layout: post.html
title: "Your title here"
tags: [list, of relevant, tags]
---
```

## Submission Method

To submit your post:

1. Save the file in _posts.

2. Test your changes locally. Start up mynt as per the [instructions in our README](https://github.com/pyladies/pyladies#to-run-locally).

3. Make sure that your changes look good, and that there are no errors or formatting issues. If you find problems, stop mynt, make the changes, restart, and check the site again.

When you submit a pull request, everyone with commit access for Pyladies will see it.
